This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio, built with Next.js and TypeScript. The project serves as a technical showcase of high-integrity engineering systems integrated with probabilistic AI frameworks.

## Core Projects

### Bayesian SAR Orchestrator
A professional search and rescue simulation platform that implements Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian inference to optimize maritime search patterns.
*   **Methodology**: Probabilistic distribution analysis based on environmental forcing (wind and current leeway).
*   **Key Metrics**: Probability of Containment (POC), Most Probable Position (MPP), and entropy-based uncertainty quantification.
*   **Technology**: High-performance canvas rendering for stochastic point clouds.

### Ship Grounding Risk Assessment
A causal inference engine designed to evaluate the probability of vessel grounding through structural stability analysis.
*   **Core Logic**: Real-time GZ curve calculation and hydrostatics verification.
*   **Architecture**: Bayesian belief network (DAG) implementation for diagnostic and predictive safety assessment.

### Rules Semantic Graph-RAG
An agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system specialized in interpreting complex maritime regulations and engineering standards.
*   **Implementation**: Utilizes graph-based semantic relationships to navigate technical documentation with high precision.

## Technical Stack

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript.
*   **Styling**: Modern CSS with a focus on technical minimalism and responsive design.
*   **Animation**: Custom-built particle system representing dynamic Bayesian network structures (Priors, Evidence, Likelihood, and Posteriori).
*   **Deployment**: Vercel production infrastructure.

## Professional Objective

The objective of this project is to bridge the gap between traditional Naval Architecture/Marine Engineering and modern AI research, focusing on the application of probabilistic methods to critical maritime infrastructure.

## Development

The project is configured for continuous deployment. Any modification pushed to the primary branch is automatically built and deployed to the production environment.
